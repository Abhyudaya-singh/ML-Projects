# Vegetable Quality Prediction Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the quality of vegetables based on their images. The goal is to provide a reliable and automated method for assessing the quality of vegetables, which can be particularly useful for quality control in agriculture, retail, and food processing industries.

# Key Features
Image-Based Analysis: Utilizes CNNs to analyze and predict vegetable quality from images.
Preprocessing: Includes image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model performance.
Model Architecture: Designed a robust CNN architecture optimized for feature extraction and classification of vegetable images.

# Data
The model is trained on a dataset of vegetable images, which includes various types of vegetables with different quality levels. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate comprehensive evaluation.

# Results
The model demonstrates competitive performance in predicting vegetable quality with high accuracy.
